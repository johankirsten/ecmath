ecmath is a library that implements the arithmetic to add two points on an elliptice curve and multiply a point on the elliptic curve with an integer. The elliptice curve arithmetic is done over a finite field.

## Features

- Add two points on an elliptic curve over a finite field
- Multiply a point on an elliptic curve over a finite field with an integer

## Installation

ecmath requires Python 3 to run. Use pip to install the library

```sh
